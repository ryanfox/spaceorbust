Space or Bust

=============
What is it?
=============
The Internet Aeronautics and Space Administration wants you!  They have
acquired all the parts to build a working spacecraft, but in typical IASA
fashion, got distracted by cat videos and seem to have misplaced them all.
Tranquility Base is running out of bacon, and the Space President has ordered
you to do whatever it takes to restock them.  Can your team assemble the
spacecraft in time to get them their precious supplies?

Currently the game isn't much of a game, but it's working its way toward
a minimum playable state.  Things we would like to eventually add:

- Art
- AI players
- Dispatch with holdovers from physical game (e.g. "cards")
- Mobile UI
And more!

================
How do you play?
================
It's a multiplayer cooperative game, meaning all the players work together
toward a shared goal.  In this case, launch a viable spacecraft!
The rules are identical to the card game *Hanabi*.  You can find information
on the game `at BoardGameGeek
<http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/98778/hanabi>`_.  The general idea is
that players cooperate to add spacecraft parts to the launchpad, but there's a
catch: they can see everyone's cards but their own.  Players can help each
other out by giving hints, but time is running short.  By building parts in
the right order, you can get the brave astronauts on the moon their rations!
